ZiPatcher is a tool for SugarCRM that allows you to easily create module loadable packages. To install ZiPatcher download the Zip of ZiPatcher and module load it into your SugarCRM instance. Once loaded you should be able to access it by going to http://<your sugar instance>/ZiPatcher/index.php where it will highlight customizations you have done on your instance. Any customizations you select will be packaged into a module loadable zip file. If you select a SugarBean or Business Logic Hook, it will account for them and create a proper manifest for them.
